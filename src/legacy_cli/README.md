# Legacy CLI Interface (Deprecated)

This directory contains the original Command Line Interface (CLI) implementation of the Personal Operating System (POS), which has been deprecated in favor of the Textual-based Terminal User Interface (TUI).

## Deprecation Notice

As of version 0.2.0, the CLI interface is considered deprecated and will be fully removed in a future version. All new development will focus on the Textual-based TUI.

## Using the Legacy CLI

While it's not recommended for new users, the legacy CLI can still be accessed using:

```
python main.py --cli
```

## Migration to Textual TUI

All functionality from the CLI has been or will be migrated to the Textual TUI interface. Users should transition to the new interface by running:

```
python main.py
```

For details on the original CLI design, see the archived project scope document at `docs/archived/PROJECT_SCOPE_CLI.md`.
