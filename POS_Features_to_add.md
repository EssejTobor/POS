# Features to ADD

1. - **Color-Coded Status and Priority:**  
  Use rich's color styling to dynamically change the color of text based on item status or priority. For example, display completed tasks in green, in-progress tasks in yellow, and pending tasks in red. This can make it easier to visually scan for critical items.

2. - **Tree or Hierarchical View:**  
  Incorporate a tree view using rich's `Tree` component. You could show a hierarchical breakdown of goals, with each goal as a branch and its work items as leaves. This gives a more organized, nested view of your tasks.
