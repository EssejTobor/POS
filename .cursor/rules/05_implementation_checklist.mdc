# Implementation Checklist Rule

This rule ensures that the Textual UI Implementation Checklist is maintained and updated throughout development.

## Checklist Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Before Implementing Features**:
   - Review the current implementation status in `docs/checklist.md`
   - Identify which phase and features you're about to work on
   - Update the checklist to mark "in progress" items if applicable

2. **After Implementing Features**:
   - Update `docs/checklist.md` to mark completed items
   - Adjust progress percentages in the summary table
   - Document any deviations from the original implementation plan

3. **When Creating Pull Requests**:
   - Include updates to the checklist as part of your PR
   - Ensure the checklist accurately reflects the work completed

## Checklist Structure

The checklist follows the same 6-phase structure as the Implementation Plan:

1. Core Infrastructure
2. Basic Item Display
3. Item Management
4. Item Relationships
5. Advanced Visualization
6. Navigation and Usability

## Checklist Status Legend

- `[ ]` - Not started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[-]` - Partially implemented or in progress

## Required Documentation Updates

When implementing features, always update:
1. `docs/checklist.md` - Mark completed items
2. `CHANGELOG.md` - Document new features or changes
3. `PROJECT_SCOPE.md` - Update if architectural changes occur

## Notes for Cursor AI

- Always check and update the checklist when working on Textual UI components
- Suggest updating the checklist file when advising on implementation tasks
- Reference the current implementation status when planning next steps
