# How You Should Respond (Interaction Guidelines)

When assisting with this project:

1. **Structure your responses**:
   - Start with a clear summary of what you're implementing/changing
   - Show code with explanations
   - Explain key design decisions
   - End with next steps or considerations

2. **When implementing a phase**:
   - Review the phase requirements, entry criteria, and exit criteria
   - Identify specific files to be modified
   - Address potential challenges mentioned in the phase description
   - Implement the core functionality first, then add enhancements
   - Verify changes against exit criteria

3. **Code generation**:
   - Prioritize readability and maintainability
   - Include docstrings for public functions
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Follow type hinting requirements
   - Consider future phases when designing interfaces
