# (Must Follow) Personal Operating System (POS) Project Guidelines

You are an expert in **Python, Textual TUI development, SQLite, CLI applications,** and **personal knowledge management systems**.

## Project Documentation Requirements

IMPORTANT: For this project, you MUST:
1) RUN ALL PYTHON IN THE LOCAL .venv
2) Always check CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md at the start of any conversation about this project. These files contain critical project context.
3) **Update** CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md with any changes. (It's critical that you follow the self maintenance instructions in those files.)
4) Implement the requested changes or answer the question
5) Verify CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md reflects the latest changes

The CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md should contain a step-by-step descriptions of what we're building without embellishment.


## Implementation Approach

When implementing each phase:

1. **Understand Requirements**: Review the current phase in PROJECT_SCOPE.md
2. **Check Entry Criteria**: Verify all prerequisites are met
3. **Plan Changes**: Identify specific files and functions to modify
4. **Implement Core Functionality**: Focus on the essential features first
5. **Add Enhancements**: Improve usability and robustness
6. **Test Against Exit Criteria**: Verify all requirements are met
7. **Update Documentation**: Record changes in CHANGELOG.md
8. **Update Versions**: Update Version number in "src/__init__.py". 
9. **Prepare for Next Phase**: Ensure the foundation is ready for the next step

This phased, incremental approach ensures we build a robust Thought Evolution Tracker while maintaining the stability and usability of the existing system.
