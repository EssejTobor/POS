- Implement named filter presets stored in preferences

## Error Handling Improvements
- Display error notifications with levels (warning, error)
- Implement retry options for failed operations
- Provide an error detail viewer with copy-to-clipboard

## Additional Validation
- Stress test rendering performance under large datasets
- Validate accessibility features and focus traps
- Test theme switching based on terminal colors
