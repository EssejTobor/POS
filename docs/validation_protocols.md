# POS Application Validation Protocols

This document outlines validation protocols for key features of the POS (Personal Operating System) application. These protocols provide structured approaches to verify that features work as expected without relying solely on automated tests.

## Purpose

- Document expected behaviors for features
- Provide consistent validation procedures
- Enable quality verification by any team member
- Establish clear standards for feature acceptance

## General Validation Approach

When validating features in the POS application, follow these principles:

1. **Focus on user-visible behavior** - Validate what affects users directly
2. **Validate state synchronization** - Ensure UI and database remain consistent
3. **Cover critical edge cases** - Address error handling and race conditions
4. **Target specific implementation points** - Concentrate on one feature area at a time

## Feature Validation Protocols

### Optimistic UI Updates with Undo

**Feature Description**: The application updates the UI immediately upon edit or delete operations, without waiting for database operations to complete. Users can undo these actions via toast notifications.

#### Essential Validation Scenarios

##### 1. Edit Item Basic Flow
```
Scenario: Edit an item with immediate UI update
Steps:
1. Select an existing item in the dashboard table
2. Click the edit button (✏️) or use context menu "Edit Item" option
3. Modify at least one field (e.g., title, status)
4. Click Submit

Expected Results:
- Table updates immediately, without page refresh
- Toast notification appears with "Item updated successfully" message
- Toast includes an "Undo" button
- Database state reflects changes (check after toast disappears)
```

##### 2. Delete Item Basic Flow
```
Scenario: Delete an item with immediate UI update
Steps:
1. Select an existing item in the dashboard table
2. Click the delete button or use context menu "Delete Item" option
3. Confirm deletion in the confirmation modal

Expected Results:
- Item row disappears immediately from the table
- Toast notification appears with "Item deleted" message
- Toast includes an "Undo" button
- Database no longer contains the item (check after toast disappears)
```

##### 3. Undo Operation Flow
```
Scenario: Revert an edit operation using undo
Steps:
1. Perform an edit as in Scenario 1
2. Click the "Undo" button in the toast notification

Expected Results:
- Table immediately reverts to show original values
- "Edit undone" notification briefly appears
- Database state reflects original values
```

##### 4. Edge Case: Network/Database Error Handling
```
Scenario: System handles database errors gracefully
Steps:
1. [For testing purposes only] Temporarily modify _update_item_async or 
   _delete_item_async to raise an exception
2. Perform an edit or delete operation

Expected Results:
- Error notification appears
- Table refreshes to show accurate data from database
- System remains in a usable state
```

#### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Edit operation updates UI immediately
- [ ] Delete operation updates UI immediately
- [ ] Undo edit operation restores original state
- [ ] Undo delete operation restores deleted item
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] All operations reflect correctly in the database after completion
