# Thought Evolution Tracker Feature Context

## Overview
Extension to POS (Personal Operating System) CLI that tracks thought evolution using version control concepts from engineering. Designed to make thought processes visible, systematic, and trackable.

## Core Data Structure

### ThoughtNode
- Unique identifier (id: str)
- External thought flag (is_external: bool)
- Content (content: str)
- Parent thought reference (parent_id: str)
- Branch name (branch_name: str)
- Creation timestamp (created_at: datetime)
- Tags for categorization (tags: List[str])
- Status tracking (status: ThoughtStatus)
- Related work items (references: List[str])


## Integration Points
- Extends existing ItemType enum in models.py
- Leverages current storage system
- Utilizes display.py for visualization
- Connects with WorkItem tracking

## Key Features
- Git-like branching for thought evolution
- Attribution tracking for external thoughts
- Connection to existing work items
- Thought lineage visualization

## Technical Considerations
- Needs efficient storage of thought relationships
- Requires clear visualization of thought trees
- Must handle branching and merging of thoughts
- Should integrate smoothly with existing CLI patterns

## Strategic Alignment
This feature directly supports the mission of making personal growth systematic while creating visible artifacts of the process. It demonstrates the engineering approach to personal development.

## Success Metrics
- Ability to track thought evolution over time
- Clear visualization of thought relationships
- Successful integration with existing work tracking
- Usability within current CLI patterns
