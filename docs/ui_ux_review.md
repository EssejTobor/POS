- **ItemEntryForm**
  - Tab order follows logical progression: goal → title → type → priority → status → tags → description → link search → link type → add link → buttons.
  - Keyboard navigation works across inputs and buttons without unexpected focus traps.
  - Error messages appear beneath the form when required fields are empty.
  - Goal input accepts free-form text and does not obstruct the flow when capturing quick thoughts.
  - Thought capture works via the *THOUGHT* item type. Selecting it reveals the same description field used for tasks, keeping the workflow consistent.

Overall, the form is easy to navigate using the keyboard alone and provides clear feedback for validation errors.
